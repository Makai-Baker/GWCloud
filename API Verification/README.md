In the GW150914.ini file, I specify the path of the PSD and Calibration files as their location in my home directory on the LIGO CIT cluster. Currently, these 
files do not exist on GWCloud, however they will soon. This will cause the path of the PSD and Calibration files in the ini file to change to one on GWCloud.
